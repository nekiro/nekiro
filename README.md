# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marcin, a programmer who works primarily with C++, Lua, and JavaScript/TypeScript. I've been coding since 2015, starting out by creating automated bots for games - you know, the kind that would farm items and level up characters while you're away.

A couple years in, I got hooked on C++ when I decided to tackle building a 2D MMORPG server as a hobby project. These days, I'm all about web development - whether it's backend, frontend, or testing. I genuinely enjoy diving deep into new technologies and understanding how things work under the hood.
