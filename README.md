# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marcin, ex C++, Lua programmer.</br>
Coding since 2015, first things that I coded were "full-afk" bots to collect items and gain experience in games.</br>
Two years later I started getting into C++, because of my hobby to create 2D MMORPG engine.</br>
Nowadays I'm interested in web development, back-end, front-end and testing technologies.</br>
