# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marcin, mainly C++, Lua and Javascript (Typescript) programmer.</br>
Coding since 2015, first things I coded were "full-afk" bots to collect items and gain experience in games.</br>
Two years later I started getting into C++, because of my hobby to create 2D MMORPG server.</br>
Nowadays I'm interested in web development, back-end, front-end and testing technologies.</br>
I love to develop skills, learn things and figure out how they work.
